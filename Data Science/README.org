#+TITLE: Data Science

** Goal
The aim of this project is to focus on providing an experience of the fundamentals of data science: data wrangling.
** Issues
1. Scripting
   Write a script to retrieve intraday stock data - that is, the HLOC data for a duration of 7 days, where the time interval is one minute - for any given [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol][stock ticker]].

   Here's a list of features we expect in every data point /at minimum/: timestamp, high price, low price, opening price, closing price, volume.
  
2. Data Collection
   Collect data (using the previously created script) for these five kinds of assets:
   a. Nifty 50 (^NSEI)
   
   b. Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited (MCX.NS)
   
   c. Ethereum INR (ETH-INR)
   
   d. Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI)
   
   e. S&P BSE SENSEX (^BSESN)

   Save each one of these datasets as an appropriately named CSV file.

3. Data Visualization
   Write a script to take any arbitrary dataset with the format previously given, and return a chart showing the HLOC chart of the data.

4. Predict
   Use an LSTM to create a simple predictor.
  
** General Advice
- Use Python as the programming language (if you /really/ want to use another one, ask us first). File extension should be '.py'.
- You can use whatever libraries you want.
- Create a sub-folder named =./YOUR_ROLL_NO/= and add any and all code in that sub-folder.
- Do not copy someone else's code.
