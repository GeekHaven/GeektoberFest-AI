The aim is implementation of a movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

For now, I have added one model as an example in the 'assets' folder based on movie-rating correlation. This is the simplest possible statistical model and finds similar movies to a given movie based on highest Pearson correlation scores between ratings of different movies. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-recommender-systems-works-python-code-850a770a656b).

The folder 'datasets' contain the Dataset for the Recommender System , 'links.csv','movies.csv','tags.csv' ,'ratings.csv' whose columns headers are explained in a 'README.txt' file properly in the 'datasets' folder.
  
## General Advice
 
1. Use Python as the programming language (if you really                                want to use another one, ask us first).
2. You can use whatever libraries you want.
3. Create a sub-folder named 'YOUR_ROLL_NO' in this directory     and add any and all code in that sub-folder.
4. Do not copy someone else's code.
