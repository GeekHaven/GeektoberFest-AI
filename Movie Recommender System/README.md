The aim is implementation of a movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

For now, I have added one model as an example in the 'assets' folder based on movie-rating correlation. This is the simplest possible statistical model and finds similar movies to a given movie based on highest Pearson correlation scores between ratings of different movies. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-recommender-systems-works-python-code-850a770a656b).

The folder 'datasets' contain the Dataset for the Recommender System , 'links.csv','movies.csv','tags.csv' ,'ratings.csv' whose columns headers are explained in a 'README.txt' file properly in the 'datasets' folder.

Make any files or folders you need in this directory itself.

We will open issues as per new models to be added so stay tuned.
