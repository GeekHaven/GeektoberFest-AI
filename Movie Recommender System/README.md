The aim is implementation of a movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

For now, I have added one model as an example in the 'assets' folder based on movie-rating correlation. This is the simplest possible statistical model and finds similar movies to a given movie based on highest Pearson correlation scores between ratings of different movies. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-recommender-systems-works-python-code-850a770a656b).

The folder 'datasets' contain the Dataset for the Recommender System , 'links.csv','movies.csv','tags.csv' ,'ratings.csv' whose columns headers are explained in a 'README.txt' file properly in the 'datasets' folder.
  
## General Advice
 
1. Use Python as the programming language (if you really                                want to use another one, ask us first). File extension should be '.py'.
2. You can use whatever libraries you want.
3. Create a sub-folder named 'YOUR_ROLL_NO' in this directory     and add any and all code in that sub-folder.
4. Do not copy someone else's code.
