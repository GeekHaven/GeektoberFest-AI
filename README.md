This repository hosts a couple of interesting projects to contribute on segregated using folders, each folder will contain a readme with dataset description or link to obtaining it ,we will be opening new issues and welcome new ideas for models or implementation. Only one pull request will be merged per issue unless stated otherwise in the issue itself.
