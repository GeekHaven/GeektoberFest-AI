# HacktoberFest - AI

Repository for HacktoberFest by the Artificial Intelligence Wing,GeekHaven IIIT Allahabad.

This repository hosts a couple of interesting projects to contribute on segregated using folders, each folder will contain a readme with dataset description or link to obtaining it ,we will be opening new issues and welcome new ideas for models or implementation.

	1. Movie Recommender System  - Implementation of a movie recommendation system.We have put a basic implementation based on highest Pearson correlation scores, and expect you to solve the provided issues but even work over several other models and ideas.  

	2. XBT Predictors - This folder contains a link to Kaggleâ€™s Bitcoin Historical Data, here we try implementing a couple of RL based Algorithms so it decides whether to buy, sell, or hold an arbitrary amount of XBT based on the input from the environments(i.e. dataset).Multiple Files may be considered,see the submission folder format.
	
	3.Data Science - To obtain Dataset using Data Wangling,and plot useful curves using Visualization and Prediction made on the basis of obtained data based on certain given assets.Multiple Files may be considered,see the submission folder format.

## Guidelines
	1. Codes written in PEP - 8 format are encouraged.
	2. Copying of code is not accepted.
